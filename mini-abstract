Towards a theory of animal vision, task-agnostic principles such as efficient and sparse coding help explain how animal visual systems encode visual scenes, and deep learning models show how formal recognition tasks shape the neural circuitry of visual processing. Ultimately, however, survival and reproduction are the only "tasks" that animals face, and animal vision adapts to encode only those features that are relevant for survival in a particular ecological niche. To study how ecology constrains visual processing, we have developed a reinforcement learning (RL) framework in which an agent aims to survive in a 3-d environment that it perceives through a vision model. By analyzing those vision models that facilitate agent survival, we aim to understand the nature of survival-relevant visual processing as it emerges from the fundamental goal of survival.
