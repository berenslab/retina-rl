# This is the main entry point for control of a retinal-rl experiment. Variables
# created here will be top-level, and defaults can be set for the various parts
# of an experiment (NB: do not add comments above the defaults list or it will
# break the config system.)
framework: classification

# This is a free list of parameters that can be interpolated by the subconfigs
# in sweep, dataset, brain, and optimizer. A major use for this is interpolating
# values in the subconfigs, and then looping over them in a sweep.
