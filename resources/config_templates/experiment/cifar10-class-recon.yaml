  - _self_
  - sweep: kernel-size
  - dataset: cifar10-large
  - brain: retinal-classifier
  - optimizer: class-recon

# This is a free list of parameters that can be interpolated by the subconfigs
# in sweep, dataset, brain, and optimizer. A major use for this is interpolating
# values in the subconfigs, and then looping over them in a sweep.
